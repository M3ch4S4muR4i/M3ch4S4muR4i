        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm a junior studying Computer Science at Auburn University. I enjoy software development and programming, especially for game development, where I enjoy game design and feature implementation, among other things. These are some of the projects that I've worked on that showcase my background and skills.</p>
        
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Drift Wars</strong>: A unique tag experience with cars, where players must pass the bomb to someone else by chasing them down before it explodes, similar to the concept of hot potato. This game was fully designed and created by me, excluding some assets & art.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Farm Tycoon</strong>: A tycoon experience where players grow their farms to increase their earnings. I primarily completed the programming for this project.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Unreal Engine 5 Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on using Unreal Engine 5:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Action RPG Game</strong>: A third-person adventure game, developed with an online course, featuring an open-world environment, patrolling enemies, and basic sword attack mechanics. This project is heavily based in C++ and showcases many fundamental game development processes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ironvale</strong>: A collaborative fantasy action and adventure project in development, where I am currently focused on enemy AI behavior and mechanics in Unreal Engine 5.
            </li>
        </ul>
